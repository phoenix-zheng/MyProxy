# MyProxy
Get valid proxy list to access a specified URL like https://www.google.com

What it does:
1. Get a proxy list from a webside by HTTP Get request, or from a file
2. Access the specified URL through the proxy
3. Save the valid proxy to a file like "good.txt"
4. Show some statistics, for example ranking in minimum time, average time to access the URL.

It is a little ugly, but it is gentle.
